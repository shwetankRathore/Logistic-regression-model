BINARY CLASSIFICATION MODEL USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION

This project is done in python using only basic libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.
This small project aims to create a classification model using Logistic Regression.
This dataset has 8 features, based on that we have to predict whether a person is sufferring from diabetes or not.
I had splitted whole dataset into two parts randomly
  > 80% for training model
  > 20% for testing model
I used Logistic Regression model and gradient descent for prediction.
